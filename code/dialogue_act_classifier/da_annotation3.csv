I,  I 	B	A	retraction
overall, the quality of the news you get of most sources I would say is pretty low. 	B	A	inform
o-, off 	B	A	stalling
uh	B	A	stalling
It's	B	A	retraction
usually you get pretty incomplete coverage 	B	A	inform 
and	B	A	turnKeep
that's one of the reasons why I try and get as many sources as possible, 	B	A	inform 
where I,  why I 	B	A	selfCorrection

on, on, uh	A	B	stalling
I like listening to that when I get a chance, when I'm in the car a long enough time to listen to it, because I	A	B	inform
to, to	A	B	stalling
Right	B	A	agreement 
yeah	B	A	agreement 
I miss NPR a lot also	B	A	inform
I really like them because they give, instead of being, as your newspaper or your TV news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb, they go really in depth on topics which i think is good	B	A	inform
uh	B	A	stalling
	B	A	
Uh	A	B	turnTake stalling
And	B	A	turnTake
they also	B	A	retraction
their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than, say, your major network news and that kind of thing	B	A	inform

Uh-huh	B	A	autoPositive 
I mean, that was a joke	A	B	inform

where you, where they	B	A	selfCorrection
uh	B	A	stalling
 r-, really	B	A	stalling

I had some visitor, he was just, I don't know, fixated on that, just listened to it constantly	A	B	inform

just in-, just	A	B	selfCorrection
Uh-uh	B	A	autoPositive

and I guess that's good when it's live, if you'll really want that	A	B	inform
if you, if you'll	A	B	selfCorrection
but	A	B	turnKeep
but that's not really providing you news. 	A	B	contradict
Right	B	A	agreement 
it's it's 	A	B	stalling
it's more like a media event rather than reporting	A	B	inform
Well	B	A	stalling turnTake
but the news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event, which is something that's good also about C Span which I tune into every once in a while	B	A	contradict
ne-, news, news 	B	A	stalling
I, I	B	A	stalling
Oh	A	B	stalling
really	A	B	autoPositive 
That's kind of boring to me, I think	A	B	inform 
Yeah, it is really kind of boring	B	A	agreement 
it, it	B	A	stalling
but	B	A	turnKeep
you know	B	A	stalling
but that's if you don't watch it there, then you're going to hear somebody else's canned report, somebody else's view about it	B	A	contradict
if, if	B	A	stalling
uh	B	A	stalling
and	B	A	turnKeep
that's what you're supposed to	B	A	retraction
you're supposed, you're supposed	B	A	stalling
if you watch the news, your opinion is going to be formed on what somebody else thought about it	B	A	inform
you're going, your opinion is going	B	A	selfCorrection
about, on 	B	A	selfCorrection
Yeah	A	B	agreement 
as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own opinion, which I would  be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's	B	A	inform 
pinion, opinion	B	A	selfCorrection
haven't, would	B	A	selfCorrection
Yeah	A	B	agreement 
I guess that's true	A	B	inform

one of the ways that I get information is, every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to this thing	A	B	inform
uh	A	B	stalling
this, this	A	B	stalling
it's free inside the company	A	B	inform
it's called INTELLECT	A	B	inform

I've, I've	A	B	stalling
I've actually read the actual articles	A	B	inform

do you have any friends that have children	B	A	propositionalQuestion
I do have friends that have children	A	B	answer 
yes 	A	B	answer 
And what do they say about finding adequate child care? 	B	A	setQuestion
	A	B	
I think that may be the key word 	B	A	inform 
I think that's correct  	A	B	agreement 
They're, relatively nonexistent from what I hear from my friends	A	B	inform
uh	A	B	stalling
from uh from	A	B	stalling
It seems like even when they have consulted day care centers that are reputable, that are sort of like a chain, if I can use that word, still you have to deal with the people that, happen to be operating it locally 	A	B	inform 
uh	A	B	stalling
Right 	B	A	autoPositive 
uh	A	B	stalling
you know	A	B	stalling
and	A	B	turnKeep
uh	A	B	stalling
it's just a matter of trust, you know	A	B	inform
of, of	A	B	stalling
I think they feel that these people are under qualified basically and  underpaid, 	A	B	inform
um	A	B	stalling 
and	A	B	turnKeep
I think that sort of goes hand in hand 	A	B	inform 
it's, it's	A	B	stalling
so it's difficult for them	A	B	inform
Well	B	A	turnTake
we certainly found that to be true 	B	A	agreement 
Huh-uh 	A	B	autoPositive 
Uh	B	A	stalling
indeed we've, - 	B	A	retraction
our children are now eleven and nine 	B	A	inform
Huh-uh 	A	B	autoPositive 
And	B	A	turnKeep
we moved away from institutionalized child care --	B	A	inform
Huh-uh 	A	B	autoPositive 
if we can call those chain kind of things, like that Uh, by that name	B	A	 Inform 
Right 	A	B	autoPositive 
uh	B	A	stalling
like that, by that name	B	A	selfCorrection
Right 	A	B	autoPositive 
And found that more creative avenues were the right answer for us	B	A	inform 
uh	B	A	stalling
Huh-uh  	A	B	autoPositive 
Huh-uh 	A	B	autoPositive 
Uh	B	A	stalling
at one point in time we've had au pairs,	B	A	inform
Huh-uh 	A	B	autoPositive 
by trading services with them, 	B	A	inform 
Huh-uh   	A	B	autoPositive 
and	B	A	turnKeep
that worked for a while,  	B	A	inform 
but adequate ones were really tough to find	B	A	contradict
they were really, adequate ones were really	B	A	selfCorrection
I'm sure that's true 	A	B	Agreement 
It takes that mixture of a very mature college student, who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time, and the interest to the children	B	A	inform 
Huh-uh   	A	B	autoPositive 
	B	A	
Right 	A	B	autoPositive 
	B	A	
Right  	A	B	autoPositive 
I do have a friend, she and her roommate became live-in care givers	A	B	inform 
uh uh	A	B	stalling
that, -	A	B	retraction
she and her roommate became live-in care givers  	A	B	inform
and	A	B	turnKeep
they loved it	A	B	inform 
They had stayed with this family from the time these children were small four or five years old, up until they were well into grade school	A	B	inform 
you know	A	B	stalling
And	A	B	turnKeep
uh	A	B	stalling
she was paid very well because the parents trusted them	A	B	inform 
they, the parents	A	B	selfCorrection
and	A	B	turnKeep
they had done such a good job 	A	B	inform
you know	A	B	stalling
So I can see where someone, in a position like that, in a live-in capacity, would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the financial  to be able to do that 	A	B	inform
um	A	B	stalling
you know	A	B	stalling
you're, you're	A	B	stalling
Well	B	A	turnTake
that's true, 	B	A	Agreement 
 Yeah   	A	B	autoPositive 
and  that's something that we're struggling with now 	B	A	inform 
Yeah  	A	B	autoPositive 
I think it's just a matter of priorities  	A	B	inform
it's a terrible thing to say when you're speaking of children in that way	A	B	inform
It's uh you know it's	A	B	stalling
 but  you still have to be realistic, as well, I think 	A	B	contradict
Oh	B	A	stalling turnTake
yeah	B	A	agreement 
Yeah 	A	B	autoPositive 
	B	A	
Yeah 	A	B	autoPositive 
Much as other cultures disagree, our lives don't revolve around our children 	B	A	inform
Yeah  	A	B	autoPositive 
Yeah  	A	B	autoPositive 
And	A	B	turnKeep
that's bad to have to admit, too, 	A	B	inform
that's, that's, that's	A	B	stalling
but it's just, there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home 	A	B	contradict
uh, you know	A	B	stalling
and, and	A	B	stalling
I think that is one reason why I continue to be without children 	A	B	inform 
I, - 	A	B	retraction
it's just such a responsibility	A	B	inform
and, and	A	B	stalling
when I've had friends that have said - when you hear people say	A	B	selfCorrection
when you hear people say, it alters your life forever, please take heed <laughter>	A	B	inform
it, it	A	B	stalling
Well, I realize that's true  	A	B	inform
so, it's such a responsibility 	A	B	inform
uh	A	B	stalling
Well	B	A	turnTake
it certainly is	B	A	agreement 
Uh	B	A	stalling
if I can  )  the other side of the coin for a moment 	B	A	request
Huh-uh 	A	B	autoPositive 
It is such an honor and a thrill, to be a parent, that most of the time, it's worth it	B	A	inform
Oh	A	B	stalling
yeah	A	B	autoPositive 
	B	A	
 Huh-uh   	A	B	autoPositive 
	B	A	
Yeah <laughter>  	A	B	autoPositive 
Most of the time <laughter> 	A	B	agreement 
Well	B	A	turnTake
I just have to be honest about it  	B	A	inform
It's not always worth it	B	A	inform
Yeah  	A	B	autoPositive 
Oh	A	B	stalling
sure	A	B	autoPositive 
	B	A	
Sure  	A	B	autoPositive 
Sure  	A	B	autoPositive 
Sure 	A	B	autoPositive 
There are those times when I think, gee,  if I didn't have children I could be out playing  )  or golf 	B	A	inform
Right  	A	B	autoPositive turnTake
Right  	A	B	autoPositive 
Right  	A	B	autoPositive 
Right  	A	B	autoPositive 
but	A	B	turnKeep
it's funny	A	B	inform
you know	A	B	stalling
I did, I had	A	B	selfCorrection
you know	A	B	stalling
I had a friend that said, before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other 	A	B	inform
and	A	B	turnKeep
she got older 	A	B	inform
and	A	B	turnKeep
she said, we never do those things anyway 	A	B	inform 
but, you know	A	B	contradict
So	A	B	turnKeep
why <laughter> why 	A	B	stalling
you know	A	B	stalling
why am I waiting	A	B	inform
It's its	A	B	stalling
It's just the way your attitude changes 	A	B	inform
and	A	B	turnKeep
you mature I suppose 	A	B	inform 
But the thing about the child care I have friends that struggle financially and they both do have to work 	A	B	contradict
I, you know, I	A	B	stalling
and and	A	B	stalling
It's a matter not necessarily that she might want to stay home or he, as well, 	A	B	inform
uh	A	B	stalling
 but, you know,  they need the money  	A	B	contradict
And when I seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know, to someone else, it's just, I can imagine how emotional  it must be and multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person  or you're uncomfortable with the situation, as far as child care,	A	B	inform
uh	A	B	stalling

Humanity had to retreat 			inform
because 			turnKeep
that part of the landscape is being taken away			inform
and 			stalling
the machines are taking more and more of this landscape			inform
First the physical world with all the cars, 			inform
then they dominate the physical world

then they will start doing the intellectual work

what will remain then is the intellectual world. 			
Of course it it is a. 			
Its a matter of few years 			
that 			stalling
you launch an algorithm 			suggest

work and produce			inform
 Society still works that way. 			suggest
And that is good.			confirm
The problem is 			suggest
when 			turnKeep
these machines will land 			inform
in the intellectual world, 			inform
and then 			turnKeep
But I think 			contradict
it will still take some time.			inform
yes 			agree
they will land in the intellectual world.			inform
When they will start shaping 			suggest
how we think and 			inform
how we live our personal lives, 			inform
then			turnKeep
 Then 			turnKeep
we will be just slaves.			inform
 Then 			turnKeep
yes 			agree
that is the risk.			inform
 Why dont you never see good intentions, 			question
like why dont you see, 			turnKeep, selferror
like why you always see a dystopian society. 			question
  I dont know 			answer
I might be quite biased towards dystopian, 			suggest
may be I like too much the movie matrix too much. 			inform
Yes I tend to see more negative aspects than the positive. 			answer
 Yeah I think it steals people’s job. 			agree, suggest
it does not steals job			retract
it ends, 			inform
it just snatches, peoples jobs. 			inform
 Its not stealing, 			disconfirm
stealing is like doing something while hiding while not coming in the front.			inform
 Ofcourse they don steal, 			confirm
its the people who assign them these jobs.			inform
 Yeah.			agree
 Yeah, 			agree
Thats why they are developing ethics 			suggest
and 			stalling, turnKeep
bringing all these regulations, 			inform
we are always, always , 			turnKeep, selferror
because humans will exagerate,			inform
and 			turnKeep
may be we will exagerate 			suggest
and 			turnKeep
just become puppets in the hands of machines. 			inform
 In the hands of AI. 			inform
There will be a day when machines will be more free than us. 			inform
Where they can be more free in doing whatever they do.			inform

slaves of the machines			suggest

 I dont know, 			disconfirm
I am not against machines, 			decline suggest
I am not against robots or AI, 			decline suggest
I am not against innovation and technology. 			decline suggest
But I agree with you at some points 			contradict
when 			stalling
I see people just losing jobs.			inform
 May be its also that we are so much aware about everything 			suggest
in our surrounding and also outside our surrounding around the world we get so much information 			suggest
that we stress so much			suggest
If we do not have such media which communicates all the information. 			suggest
May be we will be more happier. 			suggest
Yeah let machines steal the jobs 			accept suggest
we will find another set of jobs			inform
Like humans we have always survived our destruction, 			inform
we create destruction 			inform
but somehow we always survive it also, 			contradict
and build on top of it, 			inform
we never we do not scumb to it. 			correct misspeaking
That will be our step to 			suggest
I dont know 			disagree
we dont have to be super worried 			inform
there will be a set of people 			inform
who will be controlling the world 			inform
whether through machines or 			inform
whether through humans 			inform
so I think we will always be on the top may 			inform
may be just selected few people, 			suggest
few people will be on the top and 			inform
they will be controlling the machines and humans, 			inform
but the scenario is not very different, 			contradict
these social media and google they control us, 			inform
in lot of ways, 			turnKeep
and 			stalling
they are using AI 			inform
to just destroy the social structure, 			inform
destroy our communication, 			inform
to increase the stress, 			inform, turnKeep
to track us down at all levels, 			inform
to have every kind of thing from us.			inform
 Yes			confirm

I dont see that			inform

that is already happening.			inform
 I dont think anything new is going to happen, 			contradict
we were controlled by the monarchs earlier, 			address suggest, inform
then the political governments, 			inform
now its these companies and 			inform
then well 			turnKeep
then why not they are using AI already to control us			correct misspeaking
Its happening right now ever where			inform
 Yes			confirm
yes. 			turnTake, agree
 And the blow that they strike on zukenberg 			inform
its nothing in compared to the power these multinationals have, 			inform
the power in making us very predictable, 			inform
whatever you search google knows 			inform
that whatever 			turnKeep
comes first is what you are going to go with.			inform
 yes and they are showing us 			suggest
what they want us to see. 			suggest
We do not have any freedom.			suggest
 what they want to show us is 			inform
what people decided to see, 			suggest
and the loop gets reinforced, 			inform
so the people will continue to see the same things. 			inform
Because they decide that . 			confirm
like  			turnKeep
its simple you search for something how this thing works  			inform
how does that work. 			question
And so on. 			turnKeep
And a solution comes up, 			inform
then if that solution gets successful 			inform
then the loop gets reinforced.			confirm
 I get what you are saying there, 			Autopositive
I see the problem there,  			confirm
what you are trying to say, 			confirm
I understand you very well			confirm
you are right that then we are not seeing anything new, 			agree
we are just seeing all the things that other people have already seen,  			inform
yeah and its all reinforced, 			agree, turnKeep
and we are becoming more and more predictable, 			inform
we are becoming more and more traceable, 			inform, turnKeep
more and more similar.			turnKeep
 this is  why at a certain point 			suggest
if nothing changes 			suggest
I say 			turnKeep
then there will be a reversion, 			confirm
between humans and machines, 			inform
where machines will be free to do whatever they want, 			inform
and these machines they will be standing on humans, 			inform
and they will be controlling us.			inform
 I dont think so, 			contradict
there will be several humans controlling these machines 			disconfirm
and these machines will control the whole of humanity, 			inform
I think there will always we a human . on the loop.			disconfirm
 it will be humans vs machines.			inform
 May be I am biased 			suggest
but 			turnKeep
I dont see us dooming anytime soon.			contradict
 10 10 years and the robots they will start going to the universities			inform
and 			turnKeep
doing research, 			inform
ten years			turnKeep
or supporting consistently, 			inform
I think it will be contained at some point, 			suggest
I dont think its going to be used in that sense 			contradict
and I hope so they dont.			inform
Well we had a nice conversation about that.			inform
How you felt, 			question
did you had difficulties or you did not.			proposition question
you did not had difficulties, 			proposition question
whether and people and and how the mental turmoil was going though.			check question
I can tell you mine one.			Promise, answer
and i can also tell you what others think about that			answer
For me 			information structuring
aaa. 			stalling
I dont think so much about the things. 			contradict
I believe that if something comes then 			confirm
i have to make myself competitive, 			inform
such that I can cope up with any kind of situation. 			suggest
Some people think a lot of things. 			suggest
Just like I had a friend he is now a professor in IIT roulkela. 			inform
He got a Phd in Japan, 			inform
some Tusukuba University. 			inform
He thought so much, 			inform
so many things, 			turnKeep
when I will go 			question
what is my scholarship,			question
 Yes			confirm
 and 			stalling
and what will be the house expense, 			question
and so many other things.			inform
 Hmmm, hmm			Autopositive

 After that he exaggerated so many things 			inform
that he actually did not go there.			inform
 Oh really 			turnTake
 Yes			confirm, autopositive
 Oh my god. 			turnTake
 My intention was 			inform
is to do a post doc, 			inform
when I was in the industry 			inform
I was getting the opportunity for the onsite.			inform, interactionStructuring
Yes			Allopositive
I will travel to US there was a client.			inform
Yeah yes			agree, autopositive
Even at that time I did not think so much.			confirm
Yeah, so. I was ready for that.			Allopositive, inform
I dint think			inform
they start like over thinking 			inform
and they kill all the excitement			confirm
Yeah, 			agree
some people think too much 			turnKeep, inform
and 			stalling
then they kill all the excitement. 			suggest
yes 			agree, turnTake
i think so			suggest
They start over thinking 			inform
and 			turnKeep
kill all the excitement			inform
 Something means, 			turnTake
Uncertainty is 			interactionStructuring
I think its a nature and that is a life.			inform
Yeah			agree
If everything you can predict, 			inform
everything you can plan then 			inform
you do not have any spikes 			suggest
and 			turnKeep
you do not have spikes in life and its like.			suggest
It becomes boring 			address suggest, inform
I think.			turnKeep
Yes yes 			accept
that the thing it becomes boring, 			suggest
and everything is scripted then 			inform
there and things are going on. 			
but I also feel 			contradict
that if you plan too much, 			address suggest
things do not work out well, 			address suggest
like your plans fail 			address suggest
because life does not goes according to your plans.			address suggest
 Of course of course			agree
 and then you get frustrated, 			inform
angry, 			inform
and with this 			confirm
i feel 			turnKeep, interactionStructuring
the controlling nature of people 			inform
it it exhibits a lot. 			inform
and then if we are controlling and things 			suggest
dont go according to us 			inform
them you go mad.			inform
 yes, 			agree
I think you are relating expectation to each and everything, 			address suggest
you have a plan and you have a expectation 			address suggest
that 			stalling
that will work out as per your expectation. 			address suggest
but that doesnt			contradict
 it may. 			offer
yeah			accept
 and and 			stalling, turnKeep
if you plan too much 			suggest
then you control			suggest
 you you try to control			suggest
 then i feel that 			inform
then if you get disappointed 			address suggest
it hurts a lot. 			address suggest
but if you dont plan so much then 			contradict
you dont get hurt. 			decline suggest
Like If things dont go according to your plan			offer
then will its okay 			question
its fine, 			accept
the flexibility is necessary.			suggest
 The flexibility 			accept suggest
and also 			stalling, turnKeep
you need to think 			turnKeep
that what are the things required to do that.			address suggest
Just like before coming to any country for education,			offer
 hmm			turnTake
 there are somethings that you can look before coming there 			offer
such as currency of that country, 			offer
that you ha to take it at the right time, 			offer
you can see the pattern of the exchange 			offer
then you can take the right decisions, 			suggest
then if you are coming so for a temp location 			suggest
you need to 			Selferror
have to see for a place that you need to accommodate your self.			offer
 yeah hmm			accept offer, turntake
 So so,			stalling, turntake
for me everything I relate to research, 			interactionStructuring
everything is just like 			turnKeep
you have a problem definition 			suggest
and these are the possible solutions.			address suggest
 yeah. 			agree
 So 			turnTake
I used to write everything in terms of that. 			address suggest
Before coming here this is my professor, 			inform
okay these are the things i have to ask him, 			instruct
like how much is my scholarship,			question
where i can stay,			question
what is the period of that, 			question
what are the future possibilities, 			question
these are the some of the things 			suggest
that 			turnKeep
you need before making a decision			inform
but the moment you have made you decision			contradict
then you go and meet with that.			instruct
 hmm			turnTake
 hmm			turnTake
 yeah 			turnTake
I agree with that			agree
 The other thing is also that 			inform
the more you 			opening
you will meet different variety of people, 			inform, information structuring
the more you will feel liberal 			inform
or 			turnKeep
the other hand conservative also. 			inform
So it depends on 			information structuring
what are the things you are expecting, 			question
One thing which was uncertain 			inform
which i did not figure out or did any research on was how the people would be. 			inform, information structuring
when i came here I felt 			inform
i l realized 			Selfcorrection
people are really nice 			suggest
really beautiful people, 			suggest
i can say that in my experience 			inform
they are the best people whoever I have met so far.			promise
 yeah 			agree
they are very good at heart 			accept suggest
most of the people. 			address suggest
 and one thing 			turnTake
i feel very nice about everyday, 			information structuring
whenever i come from home to college and 			suggest
whenever i see any person 			inform
and 			turnKeep
we have eye contact and 			inform
so i			turnKeep
i by habitually 			turnKeep
i used to say hey, 			inform
and it fun that they used to say me hey . 			inform
respond			Selferror
yeah. 			confirm
they respond			correct misspeaking
 yes 			agree
they respond			confirm
 but 			contradict
in India its like			information structuring
 its horrible. 			inform
if you say hey, 			suggest
oh you know me 			address suggest
you dont know me, 			address suggest
then why do you say hey.			address suggest
 they suspect you 			turn grab, accept suggest
as if you are going to kill them.			accept suggest
 If you say hey 			turnTake, information structuring
to a beautiful girl 			inform
then that means you are following her or something.			suggest
 yes 			accept suggest
we do not have such social norms. 			address suggest
That was my first impression of the people 			inform
in the western countries, 			turnKeep
in the malls, 			turnKeep
on the streets, 			turnKeep
people greet each other. 			inform
And 			turnKeep
as we go more and more towards these socially rich countries, 			inform
more people are open in social spheres			suggest
they while walking on the road for example 			address suggest
I really like it, 			inform
it felt like home, 			inform
it felt like I belong here.			inform
 yes , yes			agree
 I never felt any difficulties here, 			information structuring
its not that I am missing my place 			suggest
and 			turnKeep
not interacting with the environment. 			inform
And they all are nice			suggest
 What do you suggest 			suggest
that we should learn from these people.			question
 The first thing is that 			answer
what I felt 			turnKeep
in Indian is we are losing the humanity there. 			address suggest
We are going greedy day by day, 			inform
the environment the nature, 			inform
we are not bothering about that.  			inform
 hmm , hmm, yeah			turnTake, agree
 the first thing is humanity that we are loosing, 			suggest
we are saying we have a heritage culture.			suggest
 But that is in the past.			contradict
 Yes, yes			agree
 What I think is 			turnKeep 
that we are becoming a hybrid generation, 			address suggest
of half Indian and half US. 			address suggest
We are just blindly following the US.			inform
 If your one leg is somewhere and other leg somewhere, 			inform
then 			turnKeep
 you can not be balanced.			suggest
 There is always conflict between , 			turnKeep
at least with all the people in my generation, 			information structuring
whether to go traditional way Indian way, 			question
or whether to adapt or just to take up other culture, 			question
but in the TVs we see only exaggerated culture of the west. 			contradict
 They are not divorcing, they are so friendly.			suggest
 Of course, of course, 			accept suggest
they respect the other people freedom, 			address suggest
they respect other genders, 			accept suggest
they don’t discriminate against each other. 			accept suggest
They don’t control people, 			accept suggest
if two people are living with each other, 			inform
if they are having conflict, 			inform
its good they will breakup and have a better life. 			inform
 They dont discriminate, 			turnKeep
they dont control people.			inform
 Its not definite 			turnKeep
that this is the person. 			inform
Here you get more freedom to choose, 			turnTake
and be with the person who you like 			inform
in India its like once you go and get that person you are doomed, 			turnKeep, inform
because your family gets attached and its very very constraining, 			inform
I think we can change few things in those aspects.  			suggest
 Yes yes, 			agree
many of the things once 			address suggest
I came here being in India I was thinking that these are the things that we should do, 			address suggest
something that we need to change, 			address suggest
that was the perception when I was in India. 			address suggest
Now when I came here I realized that there are many things that we have to change.			information structuring
 Yes			turnTake, agree
 the root cause is parenting, 			turnTake, information structuring
everything comes from there. 			inform
Rather than making targets for our children, 			suggest
these are the things that you have to do you have to obey your parents, 			inform
these are the rituals you have to perform, 			inform
No matter what			turnKeep
you have to get good marks. 			inform
 And they never gave any reason for anything, 			inform
we have to just do it well why.			inform
So I think we should start having dialogue with our children, 			suggest
explain the things what is good what is bad, 			suggest
rather than saying that this is the thing that you should do. 			inform
yes			agree
attach explanation with everything 			address suggest
such that he will understand that what is injurious, 			address suggest
just do the explanation.			address suggest
Instead of punishing them, 			turnTake
just let them know about its problems, 			address suggest
and then let them choose, 			address suggest
because its their life.  			address suggest
 yes, of course, 			agree, turnTake
at the end it is their life, 			inform
and your focus should be to make them capable of taking their decisions, 			inform
train them to take the wise decisions, 			suggest
so there are many things that we can fix, 			inform
in the parenting 			inform
and 			turnKeep
see that rest of the society will change everything. 			suggest
 yeas.			agree
 why its always the responsibility of the girls and women to take care  			interactionStructuring
 of the family.			turnKeep
 of the brothers, 			inform
family, house , 			inform
why she will do the cleaning and the 			instruct
boy will do the outside work, 			instruct
you are making distinctions, 			inform
you are bringing discrimination at a very initial stage 			inform
and then 			turnKeep, stalling
complaining that society is transforming where no body is respecting women. 			inform
 yeah			agree
 if fathers dont respect mothers, 			inform
and 			turnKeep
if brothers dont respect sisters, 			inform
they wont respect the women when they go outside			inform
 yeah yeah			agree
 it will never happen 			suggest
that 			turnKeep
when they go into the society they will respect other women			suggest
 other women 			turnKeep
and women respecting other men.			turn grab
 if the mother is not telling her boy to behave properly, 			suggest
the boy will never behave properly			address suggest
 even I think the same 			accept suggest
that 			turnKeep
most of the Indian men have developed the mentality that women are objects.			information structuring
 and that is really really frustrating			suggest
 its pathetic for us to see			turnTake, inform
 its dangerous, 			turnKeep
if see, 			stalling
as soon you grow in your position and designation in the society there comes lot of responsibility, 			inform
freedom comes with accountability and designation comes with responsibility , 			inform
and we see lot of political leaders commenting on rape 			suggest
like means . 			stalling
are they human or not			question
 it just feels that they dont have any feelings, 			answer
  they are the leaders of the society 			suggest
and 			turnKeep
they are running the government and so, 			inform
and its not like the society made them 			disagree
its like the parenting made them			confirm
 yes			agree
I think 			turnKeep
if we have to fix something 			inform
we have to repair ourselves, 			suggest
it is the first thing we have to repair our parenting, 			suggest
we have to be vary careful about it, 			inform
we should not criticize other cultures and society like they are divorcing, 			suggest
 put the blame on them			suggest
 they are doing live-in relation, 			suggest
that is their culture 			inform
and 			turnKeep
we should respect 			suggest
and 			turnKeep
you have to think about the best values 			suggest
that we can get from there 			inform
and 			turnKeep
can bring in your parenting, 			inform
I do not feel any difference of Swedish mother and the Indian mother 			address suggest
they also care about their children 			inform
they are also affectionate about their children, 			inform
there was some celebration in the campus, 			confirm
where I have seen many mothers came with their sons and the girls also, 			confirm
they were dressing like the Indian mothers were dressed, 			confirm
yeah, a mother is mother whether she is in Europe, US or in India.			confirm
 but you will see 			contradict
that 			turnKeep
there is not a pressure a cultural ethos who is pressurizing 			interactionStructuring
that you have to obey, 			inform
you cannot have conflicts, 			inform
you have to become like Rama.			inform
Yeah 			confirm
and 			turnKeep
we dont know if he really existed, its all in the mythology.			disagree
yes thats the thing, 			agree
here you have a love, affection, you have accountability, responsibility 			inform
and			turnKeep
you are not bound to 			inform
And I think the same thing should be in India  			offer
we are learning only the things that we are shown, 			inform
we do not evaluate 			inform
we don not have the sense to evaluate the wrong from the right.			inform
yes 			confirm
the many things that I felt very pathetic this is 21st century and we are fighting for ram mandir.			suggest
and cow meat, and this 			address suggest
and we are fighting for beef, pork and chicken.			address suggest
I was pretty annoyed at these things, 			confirm
common lets talk about something that is more important, 			accept suggest
your family, 			accept suggest
your children mental health, 			inform
how your children are doing, 			inform
not what is happening in the temples, 			suggest
they are just piece of lands,  			inform
 I always think about one thing 			turnTake
We have to see that the things which were happening over the era,  			interactionStructuring
they have built 500 years ago, 			inform
because the people were thinking 			inform
that 			stalling
this the thing that we can do in our society 			inform
and 			turnKeep
they have built the society in that kind. 			inform
It is not like that 500 years ago that they have created is valid for now, 			inform
both technology has transformed, 			inform
many of the things have transformed, 			inform
education has transformed, 			inform
its fine you can use the things 			inform
and you have change your self, 			inform
so keep the good values that you are having from previous generation 			suggest
and remove the bad things from your practices, 			suggest
from your rituals, 			inform
and many things			inform
 we need to decide, 			inform
we need to change, 			inform
I agree with your on all these things 			accept suggest
because 			turnKeep
I think very similar, 			agree
and why I am always frustrated.			information structuring
I always used to have a conflict of opinion 			inform
with my friends 			inform
and 			turnKeep
basically with my family			inform
yes 			agree
many of the people which belongs to my generation			inform
yes thats very strange			agree
because 			turnKeep
we studied in the same school, 			inform
same college, 			inform
same envious, 			inform
but somehow they are more constraining 			contradict
what needs to be done and what not 			inform
like they have a very narrow minded thinking still, 			suggest
become they want to follow what their parents did 			suggest
or 			turnKeep
what the society does, 			inform
they say it that they dont care 			information structuring
but 			turnKeep
they care a care a lot, 			inform
and that is making us weak, 			suggest
and then we have to depend on others, 			suggest
we cant take our individual decision, 			suggest
I felt this as a very big drawback in indians especially, 			inform
we cant take individual decision, 			inform
here people start to take decisions what to study and what not to study. 			suggest
 yeah 			accept suggest
because that was not cultivated during the parenting, 			address suggest
everything you can see that Indian parenting is something 			address suggest
that 			turnKeep
from the very beginning they choose your clothes, 			inform
your school 			inform
what to study, 			inform
from the birth a degree is already attached			inform
 yes 			agree
depending on what everybody else in the vicinity is doing, 			inform
and whatever your cousins are doing, 			inform
 by the birth you are attached to a degree, 			inform
you are bound to do a certain profession, 			inform
everybody is selected or chosen by the parents for you, 			inform
thats why we never take the risk, 			suggest
you are always taking a safe path			inform
 a sophisticated or safest path to do that, 			inform
from your education 			inform
from your hobbies, 			inform
everything is decided by your parents 			inform
and 			turnKeep
thats why I told you that rather than deciding the things 			suggest
train the children such that they can take the responsibility 			instruct
they can take the accountability 			instruct
and 			turnKeep
they can do the things on their own. 			inform
Rather than thinking that 			suggest
or outlining that 			suggest
after twelfth you will do Engineering, 			inform
and I will have to safe dowry for girls marriage, 			inform
just educate them and train them 			inform
such that he can do whatever he wants to do, 			inform
just train them in the toughest situation, 			suggest
OK so that even if they are going outside the family 			inform
or 			turnKeep
outside the home they can live, 			suggest
they can take care of themselves 			suggest
they should learn the cooking, 			address suggest
self dependency 			address suggest
they should be able to do their things properly, 			address suggest
these are the things that we can practice, 			address suggest
and these are the things that makes them different in taking their own preconditions.			address suggest
 thats very important, 			turnTake
otherwise the moment you turn 22 			information structuring
and 			turnKeep
then you depend on someone else for your decision, 			inform
its the same for the men also,			inform
I dont see so much difference, 			contradict
women 			information structuring
yeah they are dominated and are motivated, 			confirm
the atrocities are the same, 			suggest
they are forced to get married, 			inform
and to the person who their parents want, 			inform
forced to wear clothes that the parents want, 			inform
but men just have more freedom just little more freedom, 			contradict
because they are safer 			suggest
I always feel a conflict when we looked, 			information structuring
thats genuine also, 			suggest
you have trained a person for 25 years, 			
and you were the decision makers for your children, 			
suddenly for business, 			inform
for marriage for education, 			inform
when they start taking the decisions, 			inform
the children, 			inform
now there is a conflict, 			suggest
 yes			accept suggest
 they have decided everything for you for 2025 years, 			inform
they have practiced for so long 			inform
they are habitual of doing that, 			inform
now they see that this is their right to do that, 			inform
and by taking decision by your own you cant do this, 			inform
you should not do it			disagree
 and there is a rebel kind of character 			inform
associated with the person			inform
 you have become arrogant 			turnTake
thats what I get from my parents			inform
now you can understand this thing 			confirm
that 			turnKeep
they have practiced it for 20 and 25 years, 			inform
now they are, 			Selferror
even if you are practicing something for 20-25 years, 			correct misspeaking, question
you become so rigid about it, 			suggest
because 			turnKeep
 you cannot change it			inform
and 			turnKeep
there is a saying also 			information structuring
that if you repeat a line for 100 times that becomes a truth, 			suggest
you can see that they did this thing for 20 years at least, 			inform
till you are not grown up, 			inform
till you are staying with your parents, 			inform
and all the things they decide for you, 			confirm
so there they are actually in that nature			inform
 controlling one 			inform
this transition from maximum control to less control, 			inform
okay 			Allopositive
now my child can take decisions 			inform
he can think in a certain way			inform
and you can 			inform
and 			stalling
thats the thing that 			turnKeep
no body can control 			inform
the happiness or sorrowfulness of any person			inform
the thing that they can, 			turnKeep
like if they everything do safely, 			inform
and if we do wherever they think we will be happy, 			inform
but thats not the case, 			contradict
our parents			turnKeep
otherwise 			stalling
you will become a god, 			inform
and thats why I told you that the uncertainty that makes you alive			inform
human and alive, 			inform
if everything is scripted, 			inform
your father has decided that you have to do engineering, 			inform
then you married, 			inform
everything is in a straight line and nothing happens, 			suggest
its the uncertainty that makes you live, 			inform
and 			stalling
it makes you a stronger person day by day, 			offer
if you will not taste the struggle 			offer
you will not be upgrading yourself, 			suggest
no body can control the life of any other person, 			inform
 a lot of people in India 			address suggest
they need to learn these			address suggest
yes yes, 			agree
there are many things that we have to change in Indian			inform
and 			turnKeep
all of these things are, 			completion
I can connect to parenting, 			inform
if you parenting is nice, 			inform
if you are liberal, 			inform
you are educated, 			inform
now you can take the decision wisely, 			suggest
then 			turnKeep
if you have to travel other countries 			suggest
there will not be that much pressure, 			address suggest
then you can completely go and interact with people, 			suggest
you will be ready to accept them, 			inform
because your father accepted your certain behavior, 			suggest
he belonged to other generation 			inform
you belongs to other generation 			inform
and still you have dialogues 			question
and you come up with a mutual decision 			inform
or something 			turnKeep
and 			stalling
if that practice you have in your childhood in your family, 			inform
you will not feel afraid to do the same thing with outside country, 			inform
so its a education, 			offer
its the decision making and everything 			inform
and 			stalling
its the parenting that makes you comfortable 			inform
and do the right thing, 			inform
its parenting that helps you grow good			inform
 if our parents become just a little more liberal 			completion
we might have more trust in them 			suggest
we might feel more stronger, 			suggest
that yeah whatever happens they are there for me, 			Allopositive, inform
but thats very rare, 			contradict
if you dont do according to them 			disconfirm
then you are not theirs anymore,			inform
and I think, 			turnKeep
dialog is something that makes you grow, 			inform
if I will draw the dialogue with you, 			information structuring
its not that I have to always follow the other person, 			suggest
there are some good things that I can learn from you, 			inform
and the first thing is that dialogue 			inform
second thing is that 			inform
I should also have an expectation, 			suggest
you should have analogue and you should also accept that person, 			suggest
and 			stalling
if you are not accepting that person, then you will not grow, 			inform
whatever you have 			turnKeep
you will see that 			turnKeep
this is the thing that is true 			inform
and 			stalling
rest of the things are false, 			offer
you have to do the dialogue, 			instruct
you have to accept, 			instruct
and in that way we can grow, 			suggest
we will learn from others experiences, 			suggest
 we will not have a constraining 			suggest
and a rigid mind, 			suggest
and that happens from the childhood, 			inform
it is not that what things 			turnKeep
or what mistake your father or mother made			suggest
during their age 			turnKeep
you have to do the same things just to learn, 			decline suggest
you can learn from them, 			suggest
 and for that we need to talk,			address suggest
and just to understand the mechanism of that, 			suggest
and they have to also narrate their story in that way, 			suggest
and they can also, 			turnKeep
and if they are doing some mistake 			inform
and 			stalling
they are also human being and 			suggest
they can also do mistakes, 			suggest
and 			turnKeep
you can also correct them 			address suggest
and 			stalling
 and 			stalling
we should be more free, 			offer
and 			stalling
that was our conclusion I would say			completion
I think we should be liberal, 			turn give
we should accept other persons views, 			instruct
other peoples views			turnKeep
way of living			turnKeep
 every person is having  a different mindset, 			suggest
every person is unique 			suggest
and 			stalling
every person is having a way of thinking 			inform
it should not be like what you are thinking 			disconfirm
the other person is also thinking, 			inform
you should have the acceptance of others  opinions			instruct
 in that 			turnKeep
we can create a good society, 			offer
whether in India, 			turnKeep
whether in Sweden, 			turnKeep
so acceptance in like			misspeaking
and keep learning, 			inform
such that wherever we go 			confirm
we are the same person			confirm
 if somebody is behaving good, 			suggest
his nature is good, 			address suggest
his thought process is good, 			address suggest
you should accept that 			accept
I think after few decades India will also grow in that way			suggest
yes, if we remain , 			confirm
no not remain 			disconfirm
if we keep changing ourselves,			suggest
and yes we have to 			confirm
and talking 			turnKeep
so I think we are changing, 			inform
yes the speed is not fast , 			agree
but the ideology is changing 			confirm
and we are the people who can change the ideologies, 			suggest
because 			turnkeep
thoughts are very powerful thing, 			inform
and if we can communicate your things 			inform
and 			stalling
if other person can accept that thing 			inform
so we can change one person 			suggest
and 			turnKeep
that 			turnKeep
