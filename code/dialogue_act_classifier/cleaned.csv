2616	that we stress so much	directive
2617	if we do not have such media which communicates all the information. 	directive
2618	may be we will be more happier. 	directive
2619	yeah let machines steal the jobs 	commissive
2620	we will find another set of jobs	inform
2621	like humans we have always survived our destruction, 	inform
2622	we create destruction 	inform
2623	but somehow we always survive it also, 	contradict
2624	and build on top of it, 	inform
2625	we never we do not scumb to it. 	correction
2626	that will be our step to 	directive
2627	i dont know 	accept
2628	we dont have to be super worried 	inform
2629	there will be a set of people 	inform
2630	who will be controlling the world 	inform
2631	whether through machines or 	inform
2632	whether through humans 	inform
2633	so i think we will always be on the top may 	inform
2634	may be just selected few people, 	directive
2635	few people will be on the top and 	inform
2636	they will be controlling the machines and humans, 	inform
2637	but the scenario is not very different, 	contradict
2638	these social media and google they control us, 	inform
2639	in lot of ways, 	turnmanagement
2640	and 	turnmanagement
2641	they are using ai 	inform
2642	to just destroy the social structure, 	inform
2643	destroy our communication, 	inform
2644	to increase the stress, 	turnmanagement
2645	to track us down at all levels, 	inform

2647	 yes	accept
2648	 and 	turnmanagement
2649	i dont see that	inform
2650	 and 	turnmanagement
2651	that is already happening.	inform
2652	 i dont think anything new is going to happen, 	contradict
2653	we were controlled by the monarchs earlier, 	inform
2654	then the political governments, 	inform
2655	now its these companies and 	inform
2656	then well 	turnmanagement
2657	then why not they are using ai already to control us	correction
2658	its happening right now ever where	inform
2659	 yes	accept
2660	yes. 	turnmanagement
2661	 and the blow that they strike on zukenberg 	inform
2662	its nothing in compared to the power these multinationals have, 	inform
2663	the power in making us very predictable, 	inform
2664	whatever you search google knows 	inform
2665	that whatever 	turnmanagement
2666	comes first is what you are going to go with.	inform
2667	 yes and they are showing us 	directive
2668	what they want us to see. 	directive
2669	we do not have any freedom.	directive
2670	 what they want to show us is 	inform
2671	what people decided to see, 	directive
2672	and the loop gets reinforced, 	inform
2673	so the people will continue to see the same things. 	inform
2674	because they decide that . 	accept
2675	like  	turnmanagement
2676	its simple you search for something how this thing works  	inform
2677	how does that work. 	question
2678	and so on. 	turnmanagement
2679	and a solution comes up, 	inform
2680	then if that solution gets successful 	inform
2681	then the loop gets reinforced.	accept
2682	 i get what you are saying there, 	feedback
2683	i see the problem there,  	accept
2684	what you are trying to say, 	accept
2685	i understand you very well	accept
2686	you are right that then we are not seeing anything new, 	accept
2687	we are just seeing all the things that other people have already seen,  	inform
2688	yeah and its all reinforced, 	turnmanagement
2689	and we are becoming more and more predictable, 	inform
2690	we are becoming more and more traceable, 	turnmanagement
2691	more and more similar.	turnmanagement
2692	 this is  why at a certain point 	directive
2693	if nothing changes 	directive
2694	i say 	turnmanagement
2695	then there will be a reversion, 	accept
2696	between humans and machines, 	inform
2697	where machines will be free to do whatever they want, 	inform
2698	and these machines they will be standing on humans, 	inform
2699	and they will be controlling us.	inform
2700	 i dont think so, 	contradict
2701	there will be several humans controlling these machines 	negativefeedback
2702	and these machines will control the whole of humanity, 	inform
2703	i think there will always we a human . on the loop.	negativefeedback
2704	 it will be humans vs machines.	inform
2705	 may be i am biased 	directive
2706	but 	turnmanagement
2707	i dont see us dooming anytime soon.	contradict

2765	i think so	directive
2766	they start over thinking 	inform
2767	and 	turnmanagement
2768	kill all the excitement	inform
2769	 something means, 	turnmanagement
2770	uncertainty is 	interactionstructuring
2771	i think its a nature and that is a life.	inform
2772	yeah	accept
2773	if everything you can predict, 	inform

2775	you do not have any spikes 	directive
2776	and 	turnmanagement
2777	you do not have spikes in life and its like.	directive
2778	it becomes boring 	inform
2779	i think.	turnmanagement
2780	yes yes 	commissive
2781	that the thing it becomes boring, 	directive
2782	and everything is scripted then 	inform
2783	there and things are going on. 	error
2784	but i also feel 	contradict
2785	that if you plan too much, 	commissive
2786	things do not work out well, 	commissive
2787	like your plans fail 	commissive
2788	because life does not goes according to your plans.	commissive
2789	 of course of course	accept
2790	 and then you get frustrated, 	inform
2791	angry, 	inform
2792	and with this 	accept
2793	i feel 	turnmanagement
2794	the controlling nature of people 	inform
2795	it it exhibits a lot. 	inform
2796	and then if we are controlling and things 	directive
2797	dont go according to us 	inform
2798	them you go mad.	inform
2799	 yes, 	accept
2800	i think you are relating expectation to each and everything, 	commissive
2801	you have a plan and you have a expectation 	commissive
2802	that 	turnmanagement
2803	that will work out as per your expectation. 	commissive
2804	but that doesnt	contradict
2805	 it may. 	commissive
2806	yeah	commissive
2807	 and and 	turnmanagement
2808	if you plan too much 	directive
2809	then you control	directive
2810	 you you try to control	directive
2811	 then i feel that 	inform
2812	then if you get disappointed 	commissive
2813	it hurts a lot. 	commissive
2814	but if you dont plan so much then 	contradict
2815	you dont get hurt. 	negativefeedback
2816	like if things dont go according to your plan	commissive
2817	then will its okay 	question
2818	its fine, 	commissive
2819	the flexibility is necessary.	directive
2820	 the flexibility 	commissive
2821	and also 	turnmanagement
2822	you need to think 	turnmanagement
2823	that what are the things required to do that.	commissive
2824	just like before coming to any country for education,	commissive
2825	 hmm	turnmanagement
2826	 there are somethings that you can look before coming there 	commissive
2827	such as currency of that country, 	commissive
2828	that you ha to take it at the right time, 	commissive
2829	you can see the pattern of the exchange 	commissive
2830	then you can take the right decisions, 	directive
2831	then if you are coming so for a temp location 	directive
2832	you need to 	correction
2833	have to see for a place that you need to accommodate your self.	commissive
2834	 yeah hmm	turnmanagement
2835	 so so,	turnmanagement
2836	for me everything i relate to research, 	interactionstructuring
2837	everything is just like 	turnmanagement
2838	you have a problem definition 	directive
2839	and these are the possible solutions.	commissive
2840	 yeah. 	accept
2841	 so 	turnmanagement
2842	i used to write everything in terms of that. 	commissive
2843	before coming here this is my professor, 	inform
2844	okay these are the things i have to ask him, 	directive
2845	like how much is my scholarship,	question
2846	where i can stay,	question
2847	what is the period of that, 	question
2848	what are the future possibilities, 	question
2849	these are the some of the things 	directive
2850	that 	turnmanagement
2851	you need before making a decision	inform
2852	but the moment you have made you decision	contradict
2853	then you go and meet with that.	directive
2854	 hmm	turnmanagement
2855	 hmm	turnmanagement
2856	 yeah 	turnmanagement
2857	i agree with that	accept
2858	 the other thing is also that 	inform
2859	the more you 	interactionstructuring
2860	you will meet different variety of people, 	inform
2861	the more you will feel liberal 	inform
2862	or 	turnmanagement
2863	the other hand conservative also. 	inform
2864	so it depends on 	inform
2865	what are the things you are expecting, 	question
2866	one thing which was uncertain 	inform
2867	which i did not figure out or did any research on was how the people would be. 	inform
2868	when i came here i felt 	inform
2869	i l realized 	correction
2870	people are really nice 	directive

2900	as if you are going to kill them.	commissive
2901	 if you say hey 	turnmanagement
2902	to a beautiful girl 	inform
2903	then that means you are following her or something.	directive
2904	 yes 	commissive
2905	we do not have such social norms. 	commissive
2906	that was my first impression of the people 	inform
2907	in the western countries, 	turnmanagement
2908	in the malls, 	turnmanagement
2909	on the streets, 	turnmanagement
2910	people greet each other. 	inform
2911	and 	turnmanagement
2912	as we go more and more towards these socially rich countries, 	inform
2913	more people are open in social spheres	directive
2914	they while walking on the road for example 	commissive

2922	not interacting with the environment. 	inform
2923	and they all are nice	directive
2924	 what do you suggest 	directive
2925	that we should learn from these people.	question
2926	 the first thing is that 	answer
2927	what i felt 	turnmanagement
2928	in indian is we are losing the humanity there. 	commissive
2929	we are going greedy day by day, 	inform
2930	the environment the nature, 	inform
2931	we are not bothering about that.  	inform
2932	 hmm , hmm, yeah	turnmanagement
2933	 the first thing is humanity that we are loosing, 	directive
2934	we are saying we have a heritage culture.	directive
2935	 but that is in the past.	contradict
2936	 yes, yes	accept
2937	 what i think is 	turnmanagement
2938	that we are becoming a hybrid generation, 	commissive
2939	of half indian and half us. 	commissive
2940	we are just blindly following the us.	inform
2941	 if your one leg is somewhere and other leg somewhere, 	inform
2942	then 	turnmanagement
2943	 you can not be balanced.	directive
2944	 there is always conflict between , 	turnmanagement
2945	at least with all the people in my generation, 	inform
2946	whether to go traditional way indian way, 	question
2947	or whether to adapt or just to take up other culture, 	question
2948	but in the tvs we see only exaggerated culture of the west. 	contradict
2949	 they are not divorcing, they are so friendly.	directive
2950	 of course, of course, 	commissive
2951	they respect the other people freedom, 	commissive
2952	they respect other genders, 	commissive
2953	they don’t discriminate against each other. 	commissive
2954	they don’t control people, 	commissive
2955	if two people are living with each other, 	inform
2956	if they are having conflict, 	inform
2957	its good they will breakup and have a better life. 	inform
2958	 they dont discriminate, 	turnmanagement
2959	they dont control people.	inform
2960	 its not definite 	turnmanagement
2961	that this is the person. 	inform
2962	here you get more freedom to choose, 	turnmanagement
2963	and be with the person who you like 	inform
2964	in india its like once you go and get that person you are doomed, 	turnmanagement
2965	because your family gets attached and its very very constraining, 	inform
2966	i think we can change few things in those aspects.  	directive
2967	 yes yes, 	accept
2968	many of the things once 	commissive
2969	i came here being in india i was thinking that these are the things that we should do, 	commissive
2970	something that we need to change, 	commissive
2971	that was the perception when i was in india. 	commissive
2972	now when i came here i realized that there are many things that we have to change.	inform
2973	 yes	turnmanagement
2974	 the root cause is parenting, 	turnmanagement
2975	everything comes from there. 	inform
2976	rather than making targets for our children, 	directive
2977	these are the things that you have to do you have to obey your parents, 	inform
2978	these are the rituals you have to perform, 	inform
2979	no matter what	turnmanagement
2980	you have to get good marks. 	inform
2981	 and they never gave any reason for anything, 	inform
2982	we have to just do it well why.	inform
2983	so i think we should start having dialogue with our children, 	directive
2984	explain the things what is good what is bad, 	directive
2985	rather than saying that this is the thing that you should do. 	inform
2986	yes	accept
2987	attach explanation with everything 	commissive
2988	such that he will understand that what is injurious, 	commissive
2989	just do the explanation.	commissive
2990	instead of punishing them, 	turnmanagement
2991	just let them know about its problems, 	commissive
2992	and then let them choose, 	commissive
2993	because its their life.  	commissive
2994	 yes, of course, 	turnmanagement
2995	at the end it is their life, 	inform
2996	and your focus should be to make them capable of taking their decisions, 	inform
2997	train them to take the wise decisions, 	directive
2998	so there are many things that we can fix, 	inform
2999	in the parenting 	inform
3000	and 	turnmanagement
3001	see that rest of the society will change everything. 	directive
3002	 yeas.	accept
3003	 why its always the responsibility of the girls and women to take care  	interactionstructuring
3004	 of the family.	turnmanagement

3009	you are making distinctions, 	inform
3010	you are bringing discrimination at a very initial stage 	inform
3011	and then 	turnmanagement
3012	complaining that society is transforming where no body is respecting women. 	inform
3013	 yeah	accept
3014	 if fathers dont respect mothers, 	inform
3015	and 	turnmanagement

3026	 even i think the same 	commissive
3027	that 	turnmanagement
3028	most of the indian men have developed the mentality that women are objects.	inform
3029	 and that is really really frustrating	directive
3030	 its pathetic for us to see	turnmanagement
3031	 its dangerous, 	turnmanagement
3032	if see, 	turnmanagement
3033	as soon you grow in your position and designation in the society there comes lot of responsibility, 	inform
3034	freedom comes with accountability and designation comes with responsibility , 	inform
3035	and we see lot of political leaders commenting on rape 	directive
3036	like means . 	turnmanagement

3042	and its not like the society made them 	accept
3043	its like the parenting made them	accept

3046	if we have to fix something 	inform
3047	we have to repair ourselves, 	directive
3048	it is the first thing we have to repair our parenting, 	directive
3049	we have to be vary careful about it, 	inform
3050	we should not criticize other cultures and society like they are divorcing, 	directive
3051	 put the blame on them	directive
3052	 they are doing live-in relation, 	directive
3053	that is their culture 	inform
3054	and 	turnmanagement
